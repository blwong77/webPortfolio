        <h2>Hello! I'm Bradley Wong</h2>
        <p>I am a new Software Developer living in Los Angeles, California.</p>
        <p>
          I started my journey at Thinkful a short while ago and I am excited to
          continue learning more once I officially enroll!
        </p>
        <p>Some things that I learned in the prep course are:</p>
        <div class="ulDiv">
          <!-- container for the unordered list -->
          <ul>
            <!-- an unordered list/bulleted list -->
            <li>Basic Javascript and how to make functions with it</li>
            <li>HTML and how to create the structure of a webpage</li>
            <li>CSS to style the HTML that I have written</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>About Bradley</h2>
        <p>
          Before Thinkful I was balancing college and work and around summer of
          2021 I began entertaining thoughts of enrolling in a code camp. At the
          time I bought a course off of Udemy and began to fall in love with
          Coding. I love learning new things and as I have found out there is a
          wealth of knowledge to be learned!
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time in the prep course I have had a great time
          collaborating with fellow students and am on the look out for others
          that are in need of help trying to figure out a code challenge.
        </p>
        <p>Outside of the Thinkful community you can find me:</p>
